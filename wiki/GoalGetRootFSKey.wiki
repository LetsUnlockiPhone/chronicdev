#summary Goal - Get iPod Touch 2G root FS dmg key
#labels Information

We need to be pwned to utilize the gid key with a custom program, so we have to make due with what we have until then. If you send the ramdisk to the device, and use the 'ramdisk' iBoot command, then the decrypted ramdisk will be put at 0xC000000. The memory read / display commands will only work from 0x8000000 to 0xAFFFF00, so a bug needs to be found to somehow allow us to be able to read the 0xC000000 area. If one is found, we can simply mdb/mr that block of memory, use 'strings' on it, and the last string will be the rootfs key. It may be mountable, but there is no guarantee that the file will transfer over to the computer without any corruption.
