#summary Keys and IVs from iPod touch 2G 2.1.1 firmware

=Information=

With the [http://code.google.com/p/chronicdev/wiki/ARM7Go ARM7_Go] exploit, we have recently figured out how to use the hardware AES engine to get keys and IVs for files from the 2.1.1 firmware. This page will be updated as we decrypt more keys.

To use the IV/key pairs, get xpwntool from the xpwn project on Github, and to use the root filesystem key, get vfdecrypt.

Note: ~~Now that we've done this, it should be easy to extract the 2.2 keys as well via DFU on a touch with 2.2 installed. The reason we're currently getting keys from 2.1.1 is because that's where the exploit is in the first place.~~ This is wrong, we can in fact extract 2.2 keys without 2.2 even being installed! I am going to begin adding 2.2 keys now :) -AriX 

UPDATE: Several people have questions about the significance of this. Basically, now we have what we need to do the next steps to the jailbreak, which is patch the kernel and write a ramdisk. So, we're pretty close, but not there yet.

Without further ado, here are the keys! Thanks to CPICH for writing the code to use the AES engine, AriX for decrypting the keys, and chronic, ius, and pod2g for figuring out how to write payloads for the exploit!
