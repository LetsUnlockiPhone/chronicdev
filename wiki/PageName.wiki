With the Arm7 Go exploit, we have recently figured out how to use the hardware AES engine to get keys and IVs for files from the 2.1.1 firmware. This page will be updated as we decrypt more keys.

To use the IV/key pairs, get xpwntool from the xpwn project on Github, and to use the root filesystem key, get vfdecrypt.

Without further ado, here are the keys! Thanks to CPICH for writing the code to use the AES engine, AriX for decrypting the keys, and chronic, ius, and pod2g for figuring out how to write payloads for the exploit!
