#summary How to enable Emojis
#labels Information

= Method 1 - Property List Edit =
Edit /private/var/mobile/Library/Preferences/com.apple.Preferences.plist, and add to the end:
{{{
<key>KeyboardEmojiEverywhere</key>
</true>
}}}

Or if you open it in Property List editor, just add a new value with the "{{{KeyboardEmojiEverywhere}}}" text, set it as a boolean, and check the checkbox.

= Method 2 - "Patcher" application =
westbaer has made a lightweight application to enable and disable "{{{KeyboardEmojiEverywhere}}}", without having to hack the plist manually. It is available here: http://westbaer.yourhak.com/EmojiEnabler.zip (Source included, and will probably be mirrored in the SVN sometime soon)
