=Secure_Kernel=
It is probably best to normally keep kern.secure_kernel set to 1 when you do not explicitly need it to be off. So instead of patching it, and because I would only need to use it when I am in SSH, I just added this to my /etc/profile:
{{{
sysctl -w kern.secure_kernel=0 > /dev/null 2&>1
}}}
Now, whenever you SSH in, or open MobileTerminal, it will silently turn secure_kernel to 0. Make sure you have the patch above to make the kern.secure_kernel variable writable, or this will not work.
