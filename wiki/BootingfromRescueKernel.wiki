#summary How to create a 'rescue kernel' that you can boot to for kernel patches gone wrong
#labels Information

= Introduction =

As you all know, we're working day and night on kernel patches. Unfortunately it's like a bitch and a half to restore the iPhone everytime when you've done something wrong. Here is what we are using to prevent restoring the iPhone. It's really simple but it works.

= Details =

Copy a vanilla (and pwnage-patched) kernel and rename it to kernel.backup.

{{{
cp /System/Library/Caches/com.apple.kernelcaches/kernelcache.s5l8900x /System/Library/Caches/com.apple.kernelcaches/kernel.backup
}}}

Done. Now, apply patches to your kernel. Apply them to kernelcache.s5l8900x.

When you fucked up something boot your iPhone in Recovery and start iRecovery
{{{
./iRecovery -s
}}}

Now, change the boot-path to your rescue kernel and save the nvram changes.
{{{
setenv boot-path /System/Library/Caches/com.apple.kernelcaches/kernel.backup
saveenv
}}}

Enter *reboot* or *fsboot* to boot into iPhoneOS. Now you're back, so that you can replace the kernel and patch it again. Yay!

To fix your old messed up kernel:
{{{
rm -rf /System/Library/Caches/com.apple.kernelcaches/kernelcache.s5l8900x
cp /System/Library/Caches/com.apple.kernelcaches/kernel.backup /System/Library/Caches/com.apple.kernelcaches/kernelcache.s5l8900x
}}}
