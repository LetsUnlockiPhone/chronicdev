I personally had issues compiling this on my Mac, but thanks to some help from posixninja, I got it working great.

First, download OpenSSL from here:
http://www.openssl.org/source/openssl-0.9.8h.tar.gz

Untar it, and cd to the directory it is in, in Terminal. Then, type:
./config && make

After that, rename the directory to "openssl" instead of "openssl(version)"

As long as the "openssl" folder is in the directory you are building this in,
you should be able to now compile it with:
gcc genpass.c openssl/libcrypto.a -o genpass -I openssl/include/
